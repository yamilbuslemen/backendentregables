## Known issues

- jwt is not being able to populate req.user from the cookies in the newest version of express-jwt, so we need to downgrade it to 6.1.0. Run:

`npm uninstall express-jwt`
`npm install express-jwt@6.1.0`

- When working with thunderclient te JWT is not read from the cookie. Login in the front end and use Postman instead (copy the jwt cookie manually).

- Chat: When a chat is deleted, the user is not asign a new empty chat, it just crashes the socketIO functionality.

- Cart: The same as with chat but at least there is a sign of the error in the frontend
